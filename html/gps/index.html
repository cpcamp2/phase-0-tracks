  <!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

#The purpose of semantic elements is to define and give meaning to the html document.
The Nav tag is important because it helps navigate the webpage. I also like the footer and the header tags to add home navigation links. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

#HTML pages are interpreted in their entirety from top to bottom. Elements that come first are read first.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

#I learned how useful it can be to create snippets to code more efficiently. I know I will create more snippets because of how useful they can be. I would like to know how to location my snippets in the future. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
#Creating sublime snippets. Creating them isn't very intuitive and I still don't know where to find the snippet files after they are created. By asking questions and doing research.
