Join 3 tables:

sqlite> SELECT reviews.id, stars, comment, business_id, user_id
   ...> FROM reviews
   ...> NATURAL JOIN businesses
   ...> NATURAL JOIN users;

Choose instead to just view the user's names, business name, the star rating, and the comment:

 SELECT users.First_name, businesses.name, stars, comment
   ...> FROM users
   ...> NATURAL JOIN businesses
   ...> NATURAL JOIN reviews;

   View the data of all three tables for just one particular business:

   SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, stars, comment
   ...> FROM users
   ...> NATURAL JOIN businesses
   ...> NATURAL JOIN reviews
   ...> WHERE business_id = 1;
