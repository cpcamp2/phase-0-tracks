I. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux OS?
"It was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things" - quote on Linux. Linux doesn't assume you aren't sauvy with a computer, which allows the user the maximum amount of power. It's egalitarian and just to the point.

II. What is a VPS (virtual private server)? What are the advantages of using a VPS?
It uses a virtualization software to partition physical servers into multiple virtual servers (each without it's own OS and applications). Pros: file storage, access on the fly, it protects the user's private information.

III. Optional: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It's considered unsafe. Linux let's you do basically whatever the heck it is you want to do. When you login as the root user you hail yourself a God and can just reign pure terror on your program. If you create a different user - ya you might screw it up, but not as bad as if you were the root user.
