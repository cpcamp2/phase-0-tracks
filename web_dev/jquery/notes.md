Learning jQuery in two hours:
I. Find a jQuery cheatsheet that I can use as a reference.
II. Read an introductory article on jQuery that gives me a general sense of what jQuery is and how it can be useful
III. Watch instructional videos on YouTube on basic jQuery that you can code along with. If an idea seems tough or vague, rewatch that part of the video and if you don't understand it as well as you would like then do some googling. 

Side notes:
*Take a 10 minute break every hour.
*If a concept is really hard and you feel frustrated then take 5 and have a glass of water.
*Be a friend to yourself.

The strategies I used were pretty effective, but I ended up using Codecademy towards the end to practice core concepts.
